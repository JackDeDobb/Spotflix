### OVERVIEW
Our tool is essentially a recommender system that will provide users with movie recommendations based on the songs that they listen to. We hope to explore the correlation between a userâ€™s song and movie preferences, by comparing song lyrics to movie scripts. This tool is intended for anybody with an interest in both music and movies! 

To acquire the text data, we have to first retrieve the movie scripts to create a database. We do this by scraping data from IMDB for about 1200 different movies.
